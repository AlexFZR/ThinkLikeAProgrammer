# ThinkLikeAProgrammer
Solutions to the challenges from V. Anton Spraul's book, translated in Go.

Reading this great book, the solutions to the different challenges/exercises are written in C++ . Since I don't know C++ and I am also learning Go in parallel, I am solving the exercises in Go.

The first exercise is the Luhn Checksum -> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm

Think Like a Programmer: An Introduction to Creative Problem Solving
by V. Anton Spraul

"The real challenge of programming isn't learning a language's syntax - it's learning to creativey solve problems so you can build something great.

In this one-of-kind text, author V. Anton Spraul breaks down the ways that programmers solve problems and teaches you what other introductory books often ignore: how to Think Like Programmer. Each chapter tackles a single programming concept, ike classes, pointers and recursion, and open-ended exercises throughhout challange you to apply your knowledge.

You'll also learn how to:

- Split problems into discrete components to make them easier to solve

- Make the most of code reuse with functions, classes, and libraries

- Pick the perfect data structure for a particular job

- Master more advanced programming tools like recursion and dynamic memory

- Organize your thoughts and develop strategies to tackle particular types of problems

Although the book's examples are written in C++, the creative problem-solving concepts they illustrate go beyond any particular language; in fact, they often reach outside the ream of computer science. As the most skillful programmers know, writing great code is a creative art - and the first step in creating your masterpiece is learning to Think Like a Programmer."
